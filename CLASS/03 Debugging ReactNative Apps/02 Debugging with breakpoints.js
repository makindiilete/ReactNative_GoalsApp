/*
A sure better way to debug instead of using console.log is setting breakpoints and this can easily be done with react native...

1)  Open the simulator dev menu >> Click "Debug" >> Chrome tab is opened >> Click on the "Source" tab >> Click on "debuggerWorker" >> Expand it to select any of your js file >> Add a breakpoint e.g. to the add place handler and try to add a place in the simulator.
