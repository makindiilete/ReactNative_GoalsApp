/*
1)  All react lifecycle hooks still works with react native..
2)  All the things you know regarding react state management, refs, props type validation also applies here.

So the only difference in react and native is that you use different import components for building our apps i.e. "import { Modal, Image, Button, StyleSheet, View, Text } from "react-native"; etc..
