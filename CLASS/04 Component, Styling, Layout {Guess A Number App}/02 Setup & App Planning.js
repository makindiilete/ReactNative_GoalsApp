/*
We will build an app where user enters a number and the app try to guess the entered number..
1)  We will be working with 3 screens/pages : - The first page contains the page title, input field and buttons for number submission, once the user submit a number
The 2nd screen is shown containing two buttons "Lower & Greater" and the computer try to guess the number, if computer guess wrong, we click on "Lower" button if the actual number is lower than the number the computer guess, we click on "Greater" if the actual number is greater than the number the computer guessed
 If the real number is greater than the number the computer guessed but we click on lower to cheat or confused the computer, a validation alert box is displayed to stop this...
 When the computer guess right, the 3rd screen is shown to display "Game over" and also stating the total guess the computer made before arriving at the correct answer and we have a button to Restart..*/
